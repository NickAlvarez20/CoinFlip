#Project Name
Coin Flip Simulator

#Description
This is a simple Python-based Coin Flip Simulator created as a learning project to practice basic Python programming concepts, including random number generation, user input, and basic logic. The program simulates flipping a coin and displays the result as either "Heads" or "Tails." This project was developed to explore Python's random module and to build familiarity with writing simple scripts.
Features

#Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
No additional libraries are required, as the project uses Python's built-in random module.

#Features
Simulates a coin flip using Python's random module.
Outputs the result as "Heads" or "Tails."
Simple and lightweight, ideal for learning purposes.


#Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/CoinFlip.git

#Usage

Run the Python script (coin_flip.py) from the command line:python coin_flip.py


The program will simulate a coin flip and display the result (e.g., "Heads" or "Tails").
Follow any prompts (if applicable) to repeat the simulation or exit.

Example
Assuming the project contains a basic script like this (not included here but inferred):
import random

def flip_coin():
    result = random.choice(["Heads", "Tails"])
    print(f"The coin landed on: {result}")

flip_coin()

Running the script will output something like:
The coin landed on: Heads


#Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:

Understand Python's random module and its choice function.
Practice writing clean, simple Python code.
Gain experience with basic control flow and user interaction in Python.
